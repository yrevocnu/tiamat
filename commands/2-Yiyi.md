# Edicts of Yiyi Ren, Commander of the 2nd Future Ball

I endorse the transmedia city idea.
Projects like this are a glue that will hold this culture together.

I suggest that whatever these activities are, we create cross-house teams, which are then instantaneous quorum for actions.

I entertain the creation of a Social Credit System, at least for the Low House.
It will be an interesting test for one of the events.
