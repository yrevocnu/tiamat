# The Pattern

## Recitals

0. The Pattern is a way of experimenting with forms of governing. It is proposed in the spirit of experimentation, knowledge discovery, and fun. It also provides a symbolic entity for structuring certain types of group decision making. At heart, the Pattern is a way of deciding what is important, and deciding how to decide what is important.

1. The Pattern helps decide about decisions, regulate regulations, and establishes structural premises for future decisions in terms of organisation and procedure.

2. The Pattern deploys the existing category of the House in Yrevocnu to proliferate new essential categories that are deemed essential and constitutional for Yrevocnu.

3. The community of Yrevocnu and the Pattern of Yrevocnu are not the same. Yrevocnu is the environment, the Pattern is a system operating within and upon the environment.

4. The Pattern works to set norms and resolves conflict. The Pattern establishes the procedure for both norms and conflict resolution. Conflicts must concern the categories of the Pattern. Conflict about issues outside the Pattern are not the concern of the Pattern.

5. Conflict resolution under the Pattern is binding. The Pattern does not enforce itself. The members of Yrevocnu must willingly self-enforce the proclamations of the Pattern. The Pattern is a guide it is not a law.

6. The Pattern is an autonomous system. In order to maintain its autonomy, the Pattern must constitute itself. The Pattern constitutes itself by establishing a procedure for determining what is a category subject to the Pattern, and what is the social world of Yrevocnu.

7. The procedure for defining the categories of the Pattern requires determining the conditions under which the categories of the Pattern can be discussed and adapted.

8. Issues that are outside of the specific categories of the Pattern can enter the dispute resolution and normative domain of the Pattern if they can be formulated in the relevant categories of the Pattern. The Pattern cannot resolve disputes or normative issues in the social world. \

9. Alternatively, the Houses can, by consensus, adapt or add categories to the Pattern that can address the social conflict and subject it to the conflict resolution mechanism of the Pattern.

10. The Pattern regulates Yrevocnu by regulating itself. The Pattern remains a closed system to avoid the push-pull, stimulus-response, command-control nature of rules and social structure. The Pattern instead reinterprets itself in light of social needs and demands.

11. Rules or within the categories of the Pattern must be clear and unambiguous - there is no intermediate normative validity. When a norm is created within a Pattern category, it simultaneously forms social expectations. Social norms may be ambiguous. The social validity of a norm decided within the Pattern may be intermediate or a matter of degree.


## Articles

0. The constitutional category of the Pattern is the House.

    0. All Houses must agree by consensus on the categories of the Pattern.
    1. The internal governance of the Houses is not the concern of the Pattern
    2. When a conflict is to be resolved or a norm is to be instituted a majority of Houses will determine the outcome. Resolution of a conflict within a category of the Pattern is binding. The recording and archiving of these norms and conflict resolutions should be referred to in subsequent discussions and decisions about norms and conflicts.

1. The tasks for the Pattern include:

    0. Choosing categories for the Pattern.

2. The categories of the Pattern are:

    0. Houses
