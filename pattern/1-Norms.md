# Norms

1. Normative proposals shall be passed by a consensus of the houses, not by a mere majority of the houses, as currently stated in the archival Pattern document.

## Recruiting Norms

1. People can become new Members of Yrevocnu only by attending an Event. (Such as our Bastille Day Event, our Guy Fawkes Event, etc.)

2. The Organizer of an Event decides the policy for inviting and accepting new Members for each Event. These powers supersede norms, but may also align with existing norms.

3. Generally, new potential members will be invited by an existing Member. The existing member is the Selector; the new potential member is the Selectee; this act of inviting and bringing in a new member is Selection.

4. Members should, as a rule, only Select members they are interested in, and have trust (or faith) in.

5. All new Members are, before the beginning of the first Event that they attend, sorted into a House by the Organizer.

6. Wherever possible, Selectees should be sorted into a different house than their Selector.

7. Whenever possible, intimate partners/significant others should be sorted into different Houses.

8. People can be invited to use the Discourse platform only if they are Members.
