# Forbidden Snacks

_A mythopoetic postscript to the Pattern of Yrevocnu._

I was on the radio with Trevor in Tower 2 when I heard the alarm that meant the light up top had burned out. Trevor and I were talking movement and its connection to the various component parts of our inner lives, like we did most nights when we caught overlapping shifts.

My supervisor had a more relaxed style than Trevor’s; his was old-school, strict with the schedule, and never gave anyone special treatment. I would have quit the service long ago if my boss were anything like that, and after my accident and subsequent recovery, the last thing I wanted was another drill sergeant on my case.

Amanda took a different approach to leadership; she was intuitive and a great listener. She didn’t forget, but she did forgive, and what she didn’t forget she integrated thoughtfully with what she already knew was true about you. In other words, she would understand if I was a little late dealing with the light up top, or maybe even if I failed to do it at all. It had happened before, I made no promises that it wouldn’t happen again, but I would, I had told her, try my best not to let her down.

“There’s a way to relax that muscle just by finding the thing in your mind that’s blocking you,” said Trevor. “But how do I know when I’ve found the right thing?” I asked. “You’ve got to poke around,” he said. “Give it a wiggle, see what’s loose.”

The light-out alarm went code orange, which involved a bright flashing strobe in addition to the ringing sound.

“You know, I can’t see your light anymore,” said Trevor. “Is everything alright over there?” “It’s no big deal,” I said. “I’ll go check on it in a minute.”

Changing a bulb was a whole ordeal. First you had to go down to the tower basement, find the bulb in a box, carry it up the winding staircase to the observation deck, climb a ladder onto the roof of the lighthouse, unscrew the dead bulb, plug in the fresh one and hope it worked. If it didn’t it was back to the basement for another try.

Each bulb was the size of a beach ball, so you could only really carry one at a time, and the penalty for breaking one was getting docked a shift’s worth of pay, plus a mark in your service file. And only about one in five bulbs was actually functional. There had been times when I’d been forced to try a dozen duds in a row, carrying bulbs up and down the stairs until one finally lit up when it touched the leads. It was a hateful and dispiriting process, and I resisted doing it with every fiber of my being.

The thing was, Amanda would be coming out to replace me in two hours anyway, and she was much more responsible and would surely get to work fixing the light immediately.

I unwrapped a granola bar and decided I would make a decision about how to proceed when I was finished.

I understood the risks of keeping the tower dark. We were on a rocky, perilous stretch of coastline, and before there was a lighthouse ships crashed here all the time. But what were two hours on the timescale of potential shipwrecks, which even in the unilluminated years only happened two or three times a month?

“Now my boss is asking about it,” said Trevor. “I hope you’re not even hearing me say this because you’re up top dealing with the damn thing.”

His voice was cut off by a channel change on the radio. Now it was Amanda, needles of panic pressing against her typically cool composure. “There’s a prom ship coming up the coast saying they can’t see your light,” she said. “You’ve got to get that sorted out right this instant or we’re going to have a bay full of dead kids on our hands.”

I rose from my swivel seat at the equipment and went to the window. A soupy fog had consumed the bay, poked through by a needlepoint of lights: Ewesport, the point of departure for the prom ship. Atop the brush of waves against the rocks I could hear the approaching thump of dance music. Presently, the multicolored party lights of the prom ship came into view, a throbbing electric Christmas display, gauzy and ethereal in the mist.

They were still a ways out from shore, but their doomed trajectory was clear. I could make out the voices of prom-goers now, a rustle like radio static blending with the curl and hiss of the waves.

I dashed to the basement and tore through boxes looking for a light bulb. I found one, inexplicably in with the life vests, and carried it up the stairs to the roof. Visibility up top was terrible. I climbed the ladder one-handed, light bulb clutched in the other. From the roof I could see the shapes of the people moving on the deck of the prom boat, oblivious, dancing.

I unscrewed the dead bulb, let it rest against the railing so it wouldn’t roll off the roof, and hooked up the new one. The leads touched but no light came on. A dud.

My radio was going berserk when I got back to the equipment room carrying the two dead light bulbs. “We need a status update on your light ASAP,” barked a voice I didn’t recognize. I leaned into the grill and asked the caller for ID. “This is Captain Natalie of the Octopus’ Dream,” said the voice. “We’ve got a hundred high-schoolers on this boat and I need to know if I’m about to sail them into a wall of rocks.”

In my fear of having fucked up so irrevocably that I could never again have any kind of a normal life, solely responsible for the deaths by drowning of the Ewesport senior class of 2020, I froze, the dead bulbs dangling from my hands like a droplets of water from an icicle. The screams, the horror—and then the shame, the guilt. I would be fired for sure, sued to ruin by the school and the parents. Amanda would be implicated for not having disciplined me more strongly in the past, thereby averting this unthinkable disaster. Trevor and Captain Natalie would be the witnesses to my fatal incompetence.

“Find the part that’s blocking you,” I heard Trevor saying. “Give it a wiggle. See what’s lose.”

I dropped both light bulbs to the ground, shattering them, and ran as fast as I could to the basement. I snatched a dozen bulbs and stacked them in a box, completely against regulation. As I tore back up to the roof, I dropped a few more, the explosions of glass chasing me as I climbed the spiral.

On the roof I tried them out with sweaty and shaking hands. Unscrew one, screw in another. Dead. Dead. The voices of the high-schoolers were clearly audible now. I could hear what they were saying, identify the song that was playing. They had no idea where they were going; they couldn’t see a thing in front of them.

I unscrewed the bulb, screwed in another, and the light came on so bright it knocked me backward.

I turned toward the boat, the deck spotlit by the beacon I’d just reconnected. The kids were shielding their eyes, all of them in formal wear, looking at the spot that would have shortly claimed their lives.

The Octopus’ Dream was a big boat and turned slowly, but soon it was in profile, arcing away from the tower and the rocks under the steady hand of Captain Natalie.
